## How to Use

</div>

This bot starts with an empty [`alts.json`](/alts.json) file that will be populated with all alts submitted via the [`+addalt`](/commands/addalt.js) command. Thanks to the nature of `fs`, a built in node.js module, new alt data is physically written to the JSON file. This means that your data will be preserved, even if you restart your bot.

All users can use the [`+alt`](/commands/alt.js) command (once every thirty minutes), which will send them an embedded link to your page. After a minute and thirty second has passed, one alt will be removed from the JSON list and sent to the user. This will also be logged to the channel specified in [`config.json`](/config.json)
